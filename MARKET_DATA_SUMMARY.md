## 📊 UHS VS PEERS COMPARISON

| Company | EV/EBITDA | Focus | Quality |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **UHS (current)** | **6.4x** | Acute + Behavioral | Diversified |
| Acadia Healthcare | 7.3x | Behavioral only | Pure-play |
| Tenet Healthcare | 6.3x | Acute only | Comparable |
| HCA Healthcare | 9-10x | Acute only | Premium |
| Industry Average | 8.1x | Acute care | Average |

**Key Insight:** UHS trades at 6.4x blended, BELOW both pure-play comps
- Behavioral worth 8-11x (UHS has $1.57B EBITDA)
- Acute worth 6-8x (UHS has $1.21B EBITDA)
- **Implied blended multiple should be 7.5-9.0x, not 6.4x**
- **Value gap suggests 17-41% upside just from multiple re-rating**

## 💡 IMPLICATIONS FOR UHS SOTP

### Current Market is Undervaluing UHS

**What Market Implies (at 6.4x EV/EBITDA on $17.76B EV):**
- Treats entire company as one low-multiple business
- Doesn't differentiate high-margin behavioral (22.7%) from lower-margin acute (13.5%)
- Ignores that behavioral generates MORE EBITDA (56%) than acute (44%)
- Does not value owned real estate separately

**What SOTP Should Show:**
- Behavioral segment alone worth $1.57B × 9.5x = $14.9B (base case)
- Acute segment alone worth $1.21B × 7.0x = $8.5B (base case)
- Owned real estate worth $13-20B at market (vs $6.6B book)
- **Total value significantly higher than $17.76B current EV**
