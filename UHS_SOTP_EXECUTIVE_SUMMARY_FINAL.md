## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Investment Thesis

Universal Health Services owns and operates the **largest behavioral health network** and a portfolio of **28 acute care hospitals** in the United States. The company's value is significantly **understated by the market** due to:

1. **Hidden Real Estate Value**: UHS owns **90.5% of its beds**, with real estate embedded in operating EBITDA
2. **Segment Discount**: Market applies a blended multiple, failing to recognize behavioral health's **premium valuation**
3. **OpCo/PropCo Structure**: Separating operations from real estate unlocks **substantial value**

## 🔬 VALUATION METHODOLOGY

### Why Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)?

Traditional EV/EBITDA valuation **understates value** for asset-heavy healthcare operators because:

1. **Owned facilities have no rent expense** → EBITDA appears higher but includes implicit real estate return
2. **Market applies blended multiple** → Ignores that behavioral health deserves premium vs acute care
3. **Real estate not marked to market** → Book value ($6.6B) significantly understates market value

**SOTP Solution**: Separate the business into **four components** and value each appropriately:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BEHAVIORAL HEALTH                                          │
│  ┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Behavioral OpCo     │  │  Behavioral PropCo       │   │
│  │  (Operations)        │  │  (Real Estate)           │   │
│  │  Value: EBITDA × 9.5x│  │  Value: NOI ÷ 6.5% cap   │   │
│  └──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  ┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Acute OpCo          │  │  Acute PropCo            │   │
│  │  (Operations)        │  │  (Real Estate)           │   │
│  │  Value: EBITDA × 7.0x│  │  Value: NOI ÷ 6.5% cap   │   │
│  └──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Normalize EBITDA for Rent

**The Core Problem**: Reported EBITDA includes **implicit rent** on owned facilities.

#### EBITDA → EBITDAR → Normalized OpCo EBITDA

| Step | Acute Care | Behavioral Health | Source |
|------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **1. Reported EBITDA²** | $1,208M | $1,567M | 10-K (calculated) |
| (EBITDA is AFTER rent) | | | |
| **2. + Actual Rent Expense⁵** | $99M | $47M | 10-K Income Statement |
| **3. = EBITDAR** | $1,308M | $1,614M | Calculated |
| (Earnings Before Rent) | | | |
| **4. Impute Market Rent⁶** | $535M | $414M | 6% of revenue (market benchmark) |
| (On owned facilities) | | | |
| **5. - Total Rent** | ($535M) | ($414M) | Actual + Imputed |
| **6. = Normalized OpCo EBITDA** | **$773M** | **$1,200M** | **Post-rent earnings** |
| **7. PropCo NOI** | **$535M** | **$414M** | **Total rent (NNN basis)** |

**Why This Matters**:
- Traditional valuation would apply 6-7x to $2,775M EBITDA = $16-19B
- SOTP values OpCo at $1,973M post-rent EBITDA + PropCo at $949M NOI separately
- Result: **Higher total value** by recognizing real estate separately

## 🔍 CAP RATE vs DIVIDEND YIELD vs NOI: KEY CONCEPTS EXPLAINED

### The Three Related But Different Concepts

#### 1️⃣ **Net Operating Income (NOI)** = Property Cash Flow

**Definition**: Cash flow generated by a property BEFORE debt service and capital expenditures.

```
For UHS PropCo:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Gross Rent Revenue (from OpCo)    $949M
- Property Operating Expenses       $0
  (Triple-Net = tenant pays all)
─────────────────────────────────────────
= Net Operating Income (NOI)      $949M
```

**Key Point**: In a **triple-net (NNN) lease**, NOI ≈ Rent because the tenant (OpCo) pays:
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Maintenance
- Utilities

#### 2️⃣ **Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)** = Property Valuation

**Definition**: Rate of return on a real estate investment based on the income the property generates.

```
Formula:  Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value

Or rearranged:  Property Value = NOI / Cap Rate
```

**Example for UHS PropCo**:
```
PropCo NOI:                       $949M
÷ Cap Rate:                       6.5%
─────────────────────────────────────────
= PropCo Property Value:         $14,600M
```

**What Cap Rate Represents**:
- **Unlevered return** on the real estate asset
- Similar to earnings yield (inverse of P/E ratio)
- Lower cap rate = Higher property value (and vice versa)
- Market-determined based on property type, location, quality, tenant credit

**Cap Rate Comparison**:
```
U.S. Treasury 10-Year:            4.5%  (risk-free)
Investment-Grade Bonds:           5.5%  (low risk)
Healthcare Real Estate:           6.5%  (moderate risk)
```
→ 200 bps premium over risk-free reflects: property risk, tenant risk, liquidity risk

#### 3️⃣ **Dividend Yield** = Return to REIT Equity Holders

**Definition**: Cash-on-cash return to equity investors AFTER debt service (i.e., after leverage).

```
Formula:  Dividend Yield = Annual Dividends / Equity Investment

Or: Dividend Yield = (NOI - Debt Service - G&A) / Equity Value
```

**Example: PropCo as a REIT with Leverage**:
```
PropCo Property Value:            $14,600M
Cap Rate (unlevered return):      6.5%
PropCo NOI:                       $949M

Add Leverage (65% LTV):
──────────────────────────────────────────
  Senior Debt (65% LTV):          $9,490M
  Equity Investment (35%):        $5,110M

Debt Terms:
  Interest Rate:                  6.0%
  Amortization:                   1.0% (25-year)
  Debt Constant:                  7.0%

Annual Debt Service:              $664M
  ($9,490M × 7.0%)

Cash Flow to Equity:
──────────────────────────────────────────
  PropCo NOI:                     $949M
  - Debt Service:                 ($664M)
  - REIT G&A (est 1.5%):          ($15M)
  ──────────────────────────────────────
  = Cash Available for Dividends: $270M

Dividend Yield:
  $270M / $5,110M equity =        5.3%
```

**Key Insight**: Even though cap rate is 6.5%, dividend yield is only **5.3%** due to:
- Debt service cost (6.0% interest + 1% amortization = 7.0% debt constant)
- G&A expenses
- Reserves for capex

### 📊 Visual: The Leverage Bridge

```
                    UNLEVERED (Cap Rate)           LEVERED (Dividend Yield)
                    ═════════════════════          ════════════════════════
Property Value:     $14,600M                       Debt:      $9,490M (65%)
                                                   Equity:    $5,110M (35%)

Return:             6.5% (cap rate)                Debt cost: 7.0% (constant)
                                                   Equity return: 5.3%

Cash Flow:          $949M (NOI)                    To debt:   $664M
                                                   To equity: $270M (5.3%)
```

**Why is levered return (5.3%) LOWER than unlevered (6.5%)?**

Because **debt constant (7.0%) > cap rate (6.5%)**:
- We're borrowing at 7.0% effective cost
- But the property only yields 6.5%
- **Negative leverage** = borrowing costs more than asset yields
- This is due to amortization (1%) on top of interest (6%)

### 🎯 Achieving 8% Dividend Yield

Your partner wants **8% dividend yield**. Let's see what it takes:

#### Scenario A: Increase Leverage (Keep 6.5% Cap, 6% Debt)

```
Target: $408M dividends (8% on $5,110M equity)

Required:
  NOI - Debt Service ≥ $408M + $15M G&A = $423M

With $949M NOI:
  Max Debt Service = $949M - $423M = $526M
  At 7.0% debt constant: Max Debt = $7,514M
  LTV = $7,514M / $14,600M = 51.5%

Issue: Lower LTV = MORE equity, not less
→ This path doesn't work
```

#### Scenario B: Lower Debt Cost (5% Interest + 0.5% Am = 5.5% Constant)

```
PropCo Value:                     $14,600M
LTV:                              70%
Debt:                             $10,220M
Equity:                           $4,380M

Debt Constant:                    5.5%
Annual Debt Service:              $562M

Cash to Equity:                   $949M - $562M - $15M = $372M
Dividend Yield:                   $372M / $4,380M = 8.5% ✓

Issue: 5.5% debt constant requires:
  - 5.0% interest rate (75 bps below current)
  - 30-year amortization (0.5%)
  - This may be unrealistic in current market
```

#### Scenario C: Higher NOI (Aggressive Rent - Method 1)

```
Use Rent/Bed method: NOI = $1,196M (vs $949M base)

PropCo Value:                     $1,196M / 6.5% = $18,400M
LTV:                              70%
Debt:                             $12,880M
Equity:                           $5,520M

Debt Constant:                    6.5%
Annual Debt Service:              $837M

Cash to Equity:                   $1,196M - $837M - $15M = $344M
Dividend Yield:                   $344M / $5,520M = 6.2%

Issue: Still short of 8%
```

#### Scenario D: Combination (Aggressive NOI + High Leverage + Low Debt Cost)

```
NOI (rent/bed method):            $1,196M
PropCo Value:                     $18,400M
LTV:                              75%
Debt:                             $13,800M
Equity:                           $4,600M

Debt Cost:                        5.5% constant
Debt Service:                     $759M

Cash to Equity:                   $1,196M - $759M - $15M = $422M
Dividend Yield:                   $422M / $4,600M = 9.2% ✓

DSCR (coverage):                  $1,196M / $759M = 1.58x ✓

This works! But requires:
  ✓ Aggressive rent assumption (rent/bed method)
  ✓ 75% LTV (high but acceptable for REIT)
  ✓ 5.5% debt cost (below current market)
```

### ⚠️ 8% Dividend Feasibility Assessment

| Requirement | Base Case (6% Rent) | Aggressive (Rent/Bed) | Status |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **NOI** | $949M | $1,196M | ⚠️ Rent assumption critical |
| **PropCo Value** | $14,600M | $18,400M | 26% higher |
| **LTV** | 70% | 75% | ⚠️ High but acceptable |
| **Debt Constant** | 6.5-7.0% | 5.5% | ⚠️ Below market |
| **Dividend Yield** | 6.2% | 9.2% | ✅ Exceeds 8% target |
| **DSCR** | 1.33x | 1.58x | ✅ Above 1.20x minimum |

**Conclusion**: 8% dividend is **possible but requires**:
1. Aggressive rent imputation (rent/bed method → $1,196M NOI)
2. High leverage (75% LTV)
3. Favorable debt terms (5.5% cost)

**Alternative**: Market the PropCo to yield **6-7%** with conservative assumptions, or position as **debt financing vehicle** rather than equity REIT.

### Potential Transaction Structures

#### Structure 1: Full Sale-Leaseback to REIT

```
UHS sells 100% of owned real estate → REIT/Fund
UHS leases back all properties (triple-net, 15-20 year leases)

Proceeds to UHS:
  PropCo Value:                   $14,600M (base) to $18,400M (aggressive)
  Less: Transaction costs (2%):   ($300M)
  ───────────────────────────────────────
  Net Cash to UHS:                $14,300M to $18,100M

Uses:
  - Pay down debt                 $4,379M (eliminate net debt)
  - Special dividend              $5,000M ($77/share)
  - Share buyback                 $5,000M (reduce shares 24%)
  - Retain for growth/M&A         $921M to $4,721M
```

#### Structure 2: OpCo/PropCo Spin + REIT IPO

```
UHS splits into two public companies:
  1. UHS OpCo (operations only) - 100% to existing shareholders
