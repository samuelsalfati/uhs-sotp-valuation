## THE OPPORTUNITY IN 60 SECONDS

## WHAT WE'RE BUYING

### **4-Part Business Breakdown**

| Component | Value | % of Total | What It Is |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------|
| **Behavioral OpCo** | $17.3B | 52% | 324 behavioral facilities generating $1.8B pro-forma EBITDA |
| **Behavioral RE** | $3.9B | 12% | Real estate under 303 owned behavioral facilities (94% owned) |
| **Acute OpCo** | $9.7B | 29% | 28 acute care hospitals generating $1.4B pro-forma EBITDA |
| **Acute RE** | $2.7B | 8% | Real estate under 23 owned acute hospitals (82% owned) |
| **Total EV** | **$33.5B** | **100%** | **vs $17.9B current market** |

### **Financial Snapshot (2024)**

- Revenue: **$15.8B** (44% behavioral, 56% acute)
- EBITDA: **$2.8B** (57% behavioral, 43% acute)
- Free Cash Flow: **$1.4B** (9.1% FCF yield)
- Net Debt/EBITDA: **1.58x** (investment grade)
- EBITDA Margin: 17.5% overall (22.7% behavioral, 13.5% acute)

## WHY IS IT CHEAP?

**Market treats UHS as single business at 6.4x EBITDA. Reality:**

1. **Behavioral segment deserves 9-11x** (premium quality, 22.7% margins)
2. **Acute segment deserves 6-8x** (industry average, 13.5% margins)
3. **Real estate worth $6.6B** but buried in operations (hidden value)
4. **Family control structure** = activist/hostile bids impossible = control discount

**Translation:** Public shareholders have no leverage to force value realization.

## HILL VALLEY SYNERGIES

### **Cost Synergies: $300-400M Annual Run-Rate**

| Category | Amount | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Corporate Overhead Elimination** | $150-200M | UHS has full C-suite, legal, finance, HR, IT. Consolidate into Hill Valley. |
| **Procurement Synergies** | $75-100M | Medical supplies, pharmaceuticals. Hill Valley scale + GPO leverage. |
| **IT & Systems Consolidation** | $40-60M | Eliminate duplicate EHR licenses, data centers, security. |
| **Facility Rationalization** | $35-40M | Close underperforming acute care hospitals, redeploy capital to behavioral. |
| **Total** | **$300-400M** | **= 10.8-14.4% EBITDA uplift** |

**Value Creation:** $300-400M × 10x multiple = **$3.0-4.0B** additional value = **$46-62/share**

### **Revenue Synergies: $100-150M (upside)**

- Cross-referrals between Hill Valley and UHS networks
- Payor contract optimization (combined negotiating power)
- De novo expansion in underserved behavioral markets

## KEY RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### **Risk 1: Miller Family Says No**

**Probability:** 40%
**Mitigation:**
- Offer board representation through transition
- Structure as tax-efficient exchange (rollover equity)
- Emphasize Alan Miller's legacy (he's 87, succession needed)
- Private negotiation (avoid auction dynamics)

### **Risk 2: Synergies Don't Materialize**

**Probability:** 30%
**Mitigation:**
- Conservative estimate ($300M vs industry 15-20% range = $420-560M)
- Retain UHS operational management (not corporate)
- Phased integration over 24 months
- Hire Big 4 for integration PMO

### **Risk 3: Regulatory Approval**

**Probability:** 20%
**Mitigation:**
- Both companies are US healthcare services (not competitors)
- No market concentration issues (behavioral is fragmented)
- FTC unlikely to challenge vertical integration
- Factor 9-12 month approval timeline

### **Risk 4: Refinancing Wall (2029)**

**Probability:** 80% (rates will be higher)
**Impact:** $50-75M annual interest increase
**Mitigation:**
- Use FCF to prepay senior debt
- Refi at Hill Valley's lower cost of capital
- Already factored into valuation
