  - Regulatory risk (behavioral health is heavily regulated)
  - Reimbursement pressure
  - Comparable to AAC and smaller players
- **Base (9.5x)**: Mid-range reflecting:
  - UHS's scale advantages (largest behavioral network)
  - Strong margin profile (22.7% vs peers at 18-20%)
  - Between ACHC (9.0x) and high-quality behavioral assets (10-11x)
- **Bull (11.0x)**: Premium multiple reflecting:
  - Strategic value (scarce behavioral health assets)
  - Margin expansion potential
  - Demand tailwinds (mental health crisis, de-stigmatization)

#### Transaction Comps (M&A Multiples)

| Target | Acquirer | Date | Transaction EV | LTM EBITDA | Multiple | Notes |

## Rent Imputation Methods & Benchmarks

Since UHS owns **90.5% of beds**, we must **impute market rent** on owned facilities to normalize OpCo/PropCo split.

### Method 1: Rent per Bed (Derived from UHS's Leased Facilities)

**Data from 10-K**:
- **Acute Care**: $99.1M rent / 1,246 leased beds = **$79,535/bed/year**
- **Behavioral Health**: $47.0M rent / 1,656 leased beds = **$28,382/bed/year**

**Extrapolate to Owned Beds**:
- Acute: $79,535 × 5,190 owned beds = **$413M imputed rent**
- Behavioral: $28,382 × 22,465 owned beds = **$638M imputed rent**
- **Total Imputed Rent**: **$1,050M**
- **Total Rent (actual + imputed)**: **$1,196M**

**Source**: UHS 10-K (Lease expense by segment, Owned/Leased mix)

**Pros**:
- Uses UHS's actual market data
- Reflects true triple-net rents paid

**Cons**:
- Small sample (only 9.5% of beds are leased)
- Leased facilities may not be representative

---

### Method 2: Rent as % of Revenue (Market Benchmark)

**Industry Rule of Thumb**: Healthcare facilities typically pay **5-8% of revenue** as rent (triple-net basis).

**Source**:
- Becker's Hospital Review: "Hospital Real Estate Economics" (2023)
- Healthcare Real Estate Insights (HREI) industry survey (2024)
- CBRE Healthcare Tenant Survey (2024)

**Breakdown by Property Type**:
| Facility Type | Typical Rent as % of Revenue | Source |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Behavioral Health** | 6% - 7% | HREI Survey (2024) |
| **Acute Care Hospital** | 5% - 6% | Becker's Hospital CFO Report (2023) |
| **MOBs / Outpatient** | 8% - 10% | CBRE Healthcare Tenant Survey (2024) |

**Application to UHS**:
| Segment | Revenue | Conservative (5%) | Base (6%) | Aggressive (8%) |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Acute Care** | $8,922M | $446M | $535M | $714M |
| **Behavioral Health** | $6,895M | $345M | $414M | $552M |
| **Total** | $15,817M | **$791M** | **$949M** | **$1,266M** |

**Less: Actual Rent Already Paid** ($146M):
| Scenario | Total Rent | Imputed Rent | PropCo NOI |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Conservative (5%)** | $791M | $645M | $791M |
| **Base (6%)** | $949M | $803M | $949M |
| **Aggressive (8%)** | $1,266M | $1,120M | $1,266M |

**Recommended**: **6% of revenue** ($949M NOI) is the market-based benchmark.

### Method 3: Implied from PPE Book Value

**Data from 10-K**:
- **PPE (net)**: $6,572M (after depreciation)
- **PPE (gross)**: $11,802M (original cost)

**Method 3A: Use Net PPE**
- At 6.5% cap: $6,572M × 6.5% = **$427M NOI**
- **Issue**: Book value is depreciated; doesn't reflect market value

**Method 3B: Use Gross PPE**
- At 6.5% cap: $11,802M × 6.5% = **$767M NOI**
- **Rationale**: Gross PP&E closer to replacement cost

**Source**: UHS 10-K Balance Sheet (Note 5: Property, Plant & Equipment)

**Recommended**: Use **Method 3B (Gross PPE)** as the **conservative floor** ($767M NOI).

---

### Summary: Three Rent Scenarios

| Method | Total Rent | Imputed Rent | PropCo Value (6.5% cap) | PropCo/PPE (net) | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Conservative** (PPE Gross) | $767M | $621M | $11,803M | 1.8x | Conservative floor |
| **Base** (6% of Revenue) | $949M | $803M | $14,600M | 2.2x | **Recommended base case** |
| **Aggressive** (Rent per Bed) | $1,196M | $1,050M | $18,407M | 2.8x | Upper bound |

| **2032 Senior Notes** | $500M | 5.25% | 2032 | 10-K Note 6 |
| **Revolving Credit** | $200M drawn | SOFR + 2.00% | 2027 | 10-K Note 6 |
| **Other / Finance Leases** | $272M | Various | Various | 10-K Note 6, 7 |
| **Total Debt** | **$3,922M** | | | |
| **Less: Cash** | ($543M) | | | 10-K Balance Sheet |
| **Net Debt** | **$4,379M** | | | **Calculated** |

**Source**: UHS 10-K (Note 6: Long-Term Debt, Balance Sheet)

**Blended Cost of Debt**:
- **Current**: ~5.5% (weighted average based on above)
- **Assumption for PropCo**: 6.0% (reflecting PropCo as separate entity)

## REIT Leverage & Dividend Assumptions

### PropCo REIT Financing Assumptions

For the PropCo (real estate) to achieve an **8% dividend yield**, we need to model REIT-level leverage.

#### Debt Assumptions

| Parameter | Conservative | Base | Aggressive | Source |
|-----------|-------------|------|-----------|--------|
| **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** | 60% | 65% | 70% | Typical healthcare REIT leverage |
| **Interest Rate** | 6.5% | 6.0% | 5.5% | Current healthcare real estate loan rates |
| **Amortization** | 25 years | 25 years | 30 years | Typical commercial RE amortization |
| **Debt Constant*** | 7.5% | 7.0% | 6.5% | Interest + amortization |

***Debt Constant** = Annual Debt Service / Loan Amount (includes interest + principal paydown)

**Sources**:
- Healthcare real estate loan rates: Walker & Dunlop Healthcare Finance Report (Q3 2024)
- REIT leverage: S&P Healthcare REIT Ratings Reports (VTR, HR, MPW)
- Amortization: Typical for institutional healthcare real estate loans

#### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) Requirements

| Metric | Requirement | Source |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Minimum DSCR** | 1.20x | Standard for investment-grade healthcare REIT debt |
| **Target DSCR** | 1.30x - 1.40x | Typical for new healthcare REIT loans |

**Source**: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and life insurance company underwriting standards for healthcare real estate

---

### Equity Yield Formula

To achieve an **8% dividend yield** to REIT equity holders:

```
Equity Yield = (Cap Rate - (Debt Constant × LTV)) / (1 - LTV)
```

**Example** (Base Case with $14,600M PropCo value, $949M NOI):

```
PropCo Value:            $14,600M
Cap Rate:                6.5%
NOI:                     $949M

Leverage:
  LTV:                   65%
  Debt:                  $9,490M
  Equity:                $5,110M

Debt Terms:
  Interest Rate:         6.0%
  Amortization:          1.0% (25-year)
  Debt Constant:         7.0%

Debt Service:            $9,490M × 7.0% = $664M
DSCR:                    $949M / $664M = 1.43x ✓

Cash to Equity:          $949M - $664M = $285M
Less: REIT G&A (est.):   $15M (1.5% of equity)
Cash for Dividends:      $270M

Dividend Yield:          $270M / $5,110M = 5.3%
```

**Result**: With conservative REIT underwriting (65% LTV, 1.43x DSCR), dividend yield is **5.3%, NOT 8%**.

---

### What's Required for 8% Dividend?

To achieve **8% dividend** ($408M on $5,110M equity):

**Option 1: Increase LTV to 72%**
- Debt: $10,512M
- Equity: $4,088M
- Debt Service: $10,512M × 7.0% = $736M
- DSCR: $949M / $736M = **1.29x** (still acceptable)
- Cash to Equity: $949M - $736M - $15M = $198M
- Dividend Yield: $198M / $4,088M = **4.8%** (still short)

**Option 2: Lower Debt Constant to 6.0%** (5% interest, longer am)
- Debt: $9,490M @ 65% LTV
- Debt Service: $9,490M × 6.0% = $569M
- DSCR: $949M / $569M = **1.67x** (very safe)
- Cash to Equity: $949M - $569M - $15M = $365M
- Dividend Yield: $365M / $5,110M = **7.1%** (closer, but still short)

**Option 3: Use Aggressive Rent Scenario** ($1,196M NOI)
- PropCo Value: $18,407M
- LTV: 65%
- Debt: $11,965M
- Equity: $6,442M
- Debt Service: $11,965M × 7.0% = $838M
- DSCR: $1,196M / $838M = **1.43x**
- Cash to Equity: $1,196M - $838M - $15M = $343M
- Dividend Yield: $343M / $6,442M = **5.3%**

**Conclusion**: An **8% dividend is NOT feasible** with:
- Base rent scenario ($949M NOI)
- Conservative REIT underwriting (DSCR ≥ 1.20x)
- Current debt markets (6% interest)

To reach 8%, you would need **Aggressive Rent** ($1,196M) + **75% LTV** + **5.5% debt**:
- PropCo Value: $18,407M
- LTV: 75%
- Debt: $13,805M @ 6.5% debt constant
- Debt Service: $897M
- DSCR: $1,196M / $897M = **1.33x** ✓
- Equity: $4,602M
- Cash to Equity: $1,196M - $897M - $15M = $284M
- Dividend Yield: $284M / $4,602M = **6.2%**

Still short of 8%. **Bottom line**: 8% dividend is **unrealistic** unless you accept very high leverage (80%+ LTV) and sub-1.20x DSCR.

## Next Steps for Validation

1. **OpCo Multiples**:
   - Pull latest comps from Capital IQ / Bloomberg (ACHC, THC, etc.)
   - Validate transaction multiples from PitchBook / Thomson Reuters
   - Adjust for UHS-specific factors (scale, margins, mix)

2. **PropCo Cap Rates**:
   - Validate with recent REIT acquisitions (VTR, HR 10-Qs)
   - Cross-reference with broker reports (JLL, CBRE cap rate surveys)
   - Consider UHS-specific credit risk (single-tenant concentration)

3. **Rent Imputation**:
   - Benchmark vs Triple-Net healthcare lease comps (MPW, CareTrust REIT portfolio)
   - Validate % of revenue with hospital CFO surveys
   - Consider separate rates for behavioral vs acute

4. **Dividend Feasibility**:
   - Model multiple LTV/debt cost scenarios
   - Assess whether 8% target is realistic or should be adjusted to 6-7%
   - Consider PropCo as debt vehicle vs equity REIT
