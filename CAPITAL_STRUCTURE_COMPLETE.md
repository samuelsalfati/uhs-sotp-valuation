## 🏛️ PART 1: EQUITY STRUCTURE & VOTING RIGHTS

### Share Classes Overview

| Class | Shares Outstanding | % of Total | Par Value | Exchange Listed | Convertible |
|-------|-------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Class A** | 6,576,475 | 10.1% | $0.01 | No | → Class B (1:1) |
| **Class B** | 57,726,557 | 88.9% | $0.01 | **NYSE** | N/A |
| **Class C** | 661,688 | 1.0% | $0.01 | No | → Class B (1:1) |
| **Class D** | 12,614 | 0.0% | $0.01 | No | → Class B (1:1) |
| **TOTAL** | **64,977,334** | **100%** | | | |

**Diluted Shares (including options/RSUs):** 67,896,000

### Voting Rights Structure ⭐ CRITICAL

#### Director Election (Special Voting Structure)

**Two Separate Voting Groups:**

1. **Group 1: Class A + Class C** (10.8% of shares)
   - Elect **5 directors** (majority of board)
   - Control **90.5% of voting power** on director elections
   - Each share = 1 vote

2. **Group 2: Class B + Class D** (89.2% of shares)
   - Elect **2 directors** (minority of board)
   - Control only **9.5% of voting power** on director elections
   - Each share = 1 vote

#### General Matters (Non-Director Votes)

All shares vote together, but with **different vote weights:**

| Class | Votes Per Share | Condition |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Class A** | 1 vote | Always |
| **Class B** | **0.1 vote** (one-tenth) | Always |
| **Class C** | **100 votes** | **IF** holder owns 10× Class A shares |
| **Class C** | 1 vote | If condition not met |
| **Class D** | **10 votes** | **IF** holder owns 10× Class B shares |
| **Class D** | 0.1 vote | If condition not met |

**Example:**
- 1,000 Class C shares + 10,000 Class A shares = 100,000 votes (100 votes per Class C share)
- 1,000 Class C shares + 5,000 Class A shares = 1,000 votes (1 vote per Class C share - failed condition)

---

### Control Analysis 🚨

**CRITICAL:** Alan B. Miller and his family (including CEO Marc D. Miller) control:
- Substantial majority of Class A and Class C shares
- **Can elect majority of directors WITHOUT needing other shareholders**
- **Can approve/reject most corporate actions unilaterally**

**Implications:**
- ❌ Hostile takeovers nearly impossible
- ❌ Activist campaigns face structural barriers
- ❌ Minority shareholders have limited influence
- ⚠️ **Potential conflicts of interest** (family controls company)
- ⚠️ **Trading price may be affected** (M&A unlikely)

---

## 🏢 PART 3: ASSETS BREAKDOWN

### Total Assets: $14.47 Billion

#### Property, Plant & Equipment (Net)

| Category | Gross Value | Accum. Dep. | Net Value | % of Total |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Land** | $745.7M | $0 | **$745.7M** | 11.3% |
| **Buildings & Improvements** | $7,671.2M | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| **Equipment** | $3,260.4M | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| **Property under Finance Lease** | $125.0M | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| **Construction in Progress** | $841.0M | $0 | **$841.0M** | 12.8% |
| **TOTAL PP&E** | **$11,802.3M** | **($6,071.1M)** | **$6,572.2M** | **100%** |

**Depreciation Rate:** 51.4% (assets are ~half depreciated)

**Implications:**
- Assets built 20-30 years ago (mature portfolio)
- Land value highly appreciated (book $746M likely worth $2-3B)
- Buildings: $7.67B gross suggests MASSIVE real estate holdings
- Market value likely 2-3x book value = **$13-20B total RE value**

### Asset Allocation by Segment (Estimated)

**Note:** 10-K does not separately disclose PP&E by segment. Estimated allocation:

| Segment | % of Beds | Est. PP&E | Logic |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Behavioral Health** | 79% | ~$5.2B | 24,367 / 30,803 beds |
| **Acute Care** | 21% | ~$1.4B | 6,436 / 30,803 beds |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | **$6.6B** | |

**Alternative Allocation (by revenue):**
- Behavioral: 44% of revenue → $2.9B
- Acute: 56% of revenue → $3.7B

**Reality:** Likely somewhere in between (acute care hospitals are MORE capital intensive per bed)

**Recommended:** Use 50/50 split or 60/40 (Acute/Behavioral) for conservative approach

---

### Owned vs Leased Assets

**Owned Facilities:** 329 (93.5%)
- Acute Care: 23 facilities (5,190 beds)
- Behavioral Health: 306 facilities (22,465 beds)

## 📊 PART 4: COMPLETE GAME PLAN

### PHASE 1: ✅ COMPLETED (Oct 27, 2025)

1. ✅ Extract all financial data from 10-K
2. ✅ Analyze facility portfolio (28 acute + 324 behavioral)
3. ✅ Document capital structure (shares, debt, assets)
4. ✅ Create comprehensive data files for graphing

---

### PHASE 2: CURRENT FOCUS - COMPLETE CAPITAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

#### Task 2.1: Get Current Stock Price & Market Data
**Why:** Need to calculate current market cap and enterprise value

**Actions:**
- [ ] Pull current UHS Class B stock price (NYSE: UHS)
- [ ] Calculate current market cap
- [ ] Calculate current enterprise value (Market Cap + Net Debt)
- [ ] Get 52-week high/low
- [ ] Pull historical trading multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA)

---

#### Task 2.2: Research Industry Comps & Multiples
**Why:** Need multiples to value each segment in SOTP model

**Acute Care Comparables:**
- [ ] **Tenet Healthcare (THC)** - EV/EBITDA multiple
- [ ] **HCA Healthcare (HCA)** - Premium operator benchmark
- [ ] **Community Health Systems (CYH)** - Regional comp
- [ ] Calculate median: Likely **6.5-8.0x EBITDA**

**Behavioral Health Comparables:**
- [ ] **Acadia Healthcare (ACHC)** - Pure-play behavioral
  - Expected: 10-12x EBITDA (premium to acute care)
- [ ] **Select Medical (SEM)** - Partial behavioral exposure
- [ ] Recent M&A transactions in behavioral health

**Healthcare REIT Comps (for Real Estate):**
- [ ] **Welltower (WELL)** - Cap rate
- [ ] **Healthpeak (PEAK)** - Cap rate
- [ ] **Sabra Health Care (SBRA)** - Behavioral focus
- [ ] Calculate median: Likely **6.0-7.0% cap rate**

---

### PHASE 3: BUILD FOUR-PART SOTP VALUATION MODEL

#### Task 3.1: Behavioral Health Operations Valuation

**Inputs:**
- 2024 EBITDA: $1,567M
- Rent adjustment: Add back rent on owned facilities
- Pro-forma "pure OpCo" EBITDA (as if all leased)

**Calculation:**
```
Estimated Market Rent on Owned Behavioral Facilities:
  - 306 owned facilities
  - 22,465 owned beds
  - Assume $30k-40k per bed annual rent
  - Total rent: $674M - $899M (midpoint: $787M)

Pro-forma EBITDA = $1,567M + $787M = $2,354M

Apply Multiple:
  Bear (9.0x): $21.2B
  Base (10.5x): $24.7B
  Bull (12.0x): $28.2B
```

---

#### Task 3.2: Behavioral Health Real Estate Valuation

**Method A: Replacement Cost**
- Book value behavioral RE: ~$5.2B (est. 79% of $6.6B)
- Appreciation multiplier: 2.0-3.0x
- Value: $10.4B - $15.6B

**Method B: Cap Rate**
- Annual market rent: $787M
- Cap rate: 6.0% (bull) to 7.0% (bear), 6.5% (base)
- Value: $11.2B (7.0%) to $13.1B (6.0%), midpoint $12.1B

**Method C: Per Bed**
- Comparable transactions: $150k-$250k per bed
- 22,465 owned beds
- Value: $3.4B (bear) to $5.6B (bull), $4.5B (base)

**Selected Value:** Higher of Method B and C = **$12.1B (base case)**

---

#### Task 3.3: Acute Care Operations Valuation

**Inputs:**
- 2024 EBITDA: $1,208M
- Rent adjustment: Add back rent on owned facilities

**Calculation:**
```
Estimated Market Rent on Owned Acute Facilities:
  - 23 owned facilities
  - 5,190 owned beds
  - Assume $50k-$75k per bed annual rent (higher than behavioral)
  - Total rent: $260M - $389M (midpoint: $325M)

Pro-forma EBITDA = $1,208M + $325M = $1,533M

Apply Multiple:
  Bear (6.0x): $9.2B
  Base (7.0x): $10.7B
  Bull (8.5x): $13.0B
```

---

#### Task 3.4: Acute Care Real Estate Valuation

**Method A: Book Value Appreciation**
- Book value acute RE: ~$1.4B (est. 21% of $6.6B)
- Appreciation multiplier: 2.5-3.5x (hospitals expensive!)
- Value: $3.5B - $4.9B

**Method B: Cap Rate**
- Annual market rent: $325M
- Cap rate: 6.5% (bull) to 7.5% (bear), 7.0% (base)
- Value: $4.3B (7.5%) to $5.0B (6.5%), midpoint $4.6B

**Method C: Replacement Cost**
- $1M - $1.5M per bed for new hospital
- 5,190 owned beds
- Replacement cost: $5.2B - $7.8B
- Discount for age: 60-80% of replacement
- Value: $3.1B - $6.2B

**Selected Value:** Median of three methods = **$4.6B (base case)**

---

#### Task 3.5: Corporate Overhead Adjustment

**Current Annual Overhead:** $450M (estimated, need to verify)

**Components to Remove:**
- Public company costs: ~$50M (audit, IR, legal, D&O insurance)
- Excess overhead: ~$100M (redundant functions)
- **Total savings:** $150M annually

**Value Creation:**
- Apply 10x multiple (same as OpCo)
- Value: $150M × 10 = **$1.5B**

---

#### Task 3.6: Calculate Total SOTP Value

```

```

**Bear Case:** ~$550 per share (low multiples, high cap rates)
**Bull Case:** ~$950 per share (high multiples, low cap rates)

---

### PHASE 4: SENSITIVITY & SCENARIO ANALYSIS

#### Task 4.1: Create Sensitivity Tables

**Key Drivers:**
1. Behavioral EBITDA multiple (9x - 12x)
2. Acute Care EBITDA multiple (6x - 8.5x)
3. Real Estate cap rate (6% - 7.5%)
4. Rent assumptions ($30k-$75k per bed)

**Output:**
- Two-way sensitivity matrices
- Tornado charts showing value impact
- Probability-weighted scenarios

---

#### Task 4.2: Run Three Scenarios

**Bear Case:**
- Recession: EBITDA margins compress 2%
- Multiples at low end (9x behavioral, 6x acute)
- RE at 7.5% cap rate
- No overhead savings
- **Value:** ~$550/share

**Base Case:**
- Current trends continue
- Mid-range multiples (10.5x behavioral, 7x acute)
- RE at 6.5-7.0% cap rates
- 33% overhead reduction
- **Value:** ~$757/share

**Bull Case:**
- Strong behavioral demand
- Strategic buyer interest
- High multiples (12x behavioral, 8.5x acute)
- RE at 6.0% cap rate
- REIT spin-off premium
- **Value:** ~$950/share

---

### PHASE 5: UPDATE MODEL & DASHBOARD
