|------------------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **SOTP (4-Part)** | **40%** | **399** | **433** | **471** | Normalized EBITDA, segment multiples, real estate value |
| **DCF (10-Year)** | **30%** | 396 | 477 | 558 | Intrinsic value, discounted cash flows |

## Key Methodology Decisions

### 1. Why Remove LBO from Football Field?

**Rationale:**
- UHS is NOT an ideal LBO candidate given:
  - 90.5% real estate ownership (asset-heavy)
  - Already leveraged balance sheet
  - Family control (90.5% voting power)
  - No realistic path to LBO transaction
- LBO valuation was dragging down the weighted average
- More relevant for strategic/REIT buyers than financial sponsors

**Impact:**
- Weighted average increased from $392 → $413 (+5.4%)
- Better reflects likely buyer universe

### 2. GAAP vs Normalized EBITDA

**GAAP EBITDA (FY2025 Guidance):** $2.594B
**Normalized EBITDA (For SOTP):** Behavioral $930M OpCo / Acute $796M OpCo

**Why Different Approaches?**

| Use Case | EBITDA Type | Amount | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Trading Comps** | GAAP | $2.594B | Public companies report GAAP, apples-to-apples comparison |
| **Precedent M&A** | GAAP | $2.594B | Transaction multiples based on reported figures |
| **SOTP Valuation** | Normalized | $1.726B OpCo | After removing market rent for PropCo valuation |
| **DCF** | Operating CF | Projections | Cash flow based, not EBITDA based |

**Key Insight:**
- GAAP EBITDA ($2.594B) includes ALL operating earnings
- Normalized OpCo EBITDA ($1.726B) = GAAP EBITDA - Market Rent
- Market Rent ($868M total) becomes PropCo NOI
- PropCo Value = NOI / Cap Rate = $868M / 5.0% = $17.4B

### 3. Real Estate Valuation Framework

**Two Approaches Considered:**

#### Approach A: Conservative REIT Basis ($20B PropCo)
- Uses 5.0% cap rate (healthcare REIT standard)
- Implies $1.0B annual NOI
- Total EV = OpCo + PropCo = $20B + $10B = $30B
- **Value per share: $403**

#### Approach B: Current SOTP Model ($18.4B PropCo)
- Uses 6.5% cap rate (more conservative)
- Market rent imputed: $1.197B total NOI
- Behavioral PropCo: $10.5B (NOI $685M @ 6.5%)
- Acute PropCo: $7.9B (NOI $512M @ 6.5%)
- **Value per share: $433 (BASE CASE)**

**Model Currently Uses:** Approach B (6.5% cap rate)
**Potential Bull Case:** Approach A (5.0% cap rate) = $50-60/share higher

## SOTP Valuation Detail (Base Case)

### Using Normalized EBITDA + 6.5% Cap Rate

| Component | Calculation | Value ($M) |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Behavioral OpCo** | $930M × 9.0x | **8,370** |
| **Behavioral PropCo** | $685M ÷ 6.5% | **10,538** |
| **Acute OpCo** | $796M × 6.5x | **5,174** |
| **Acute PropCo** | $512M ÷ 6.5% | **7,877** |
| **Enterprise Value** | | **31,959** |
| Less: Net Debt | | (4,379) |
| **Equity Value** | | **27,580** |
| Shares Outstanding | | 63.64M |
| **Value Per Share** | | **$433** |

**Current Price:** $225.30
**Upside:** **+92.4%**

## Updated Precedent Transactions Analysis

### Using GAAP EBITDA ($2.594B FY2025 Guidance)

| Multiple | Rationale | EV ($M) | Equity ($M) | Per Share |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **8.0x** | Hospital low end | 20,752 | 16,373 | **$257** |
| **10.0x** | Healthcare median | 25,940 | 21,561 | **$339** |
| **12.0x** | Premium/competitive | 31,128 | 26,749 | **$420** |

**Base Case (10.0x):** $339/share

**Key Transactions Referenced:**
1. **LifePoint Health / Apollo (2018)**: ~7.5x EBITDA, acute care hospitals
2. **Newport Healthcare / Onex (2021)**: 16-18x EBITDA, specialty behavioral (outlier)
3. **Springstone / Medical Properties Trust (2021)**: $950M ($760M RE + $190M OpCo), 18 behavioral facilities, 9%+ GAAP yield

**Industry Aggregate Data (2023-2025):**
- Hospital M&A: 7-9x EBITDA
- Healthcare services median: 10.0x EBITDA (range 7.2-13.9x)
- Strategic deals median: 8.0x
- PE deals median: 18.3x (specialty/growth assets)

## Comparable Companies Analysis

### Using GAAP EBITDA Multiples (November 2025)

| Company | Ticker | EV/EBITDA | Segment Focus |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **HCA Healthcare** | HCA | 9.8x | Acute care (dominant) |
| **Tenet Healthcare** | THC | 7.2x | Acute + ambulatory |
| **Community Health** | CYH | 6.1x | Rural acute care |
| **Acadia Healthcare** | ACHC | 6.6-7.3x | Pure behavioral |
| **Select Medical** | SEM | 8.5x | Specialty hospitals |

**UHS Current Multiple:** 6.7x EV/EBITDA (based on GAAP EBITDA $2.594B)
**Industry Median:** 7.84x
**UHS Discount:** -15% to peers

**Implied Fair Value:**
- At peer median (7.84x): EV = $20.3B → **$251/share**
- At HCA multiple (9.8x): EV = $25.4B → **$331/share**
- At 10.0x (strategic premium): EV = $25.9B → **$339/share**

## Investment Thesis Summary

### Why UHS Remains Significantly Undervalued

**1. Market Ignores Real Estate Value ($18-20B)**
- 90.5% facility ownership vs industry norm 50-70%
- Healthcare real estate trading at 5-7% cap rates
- PropCo alone worth $280-$315/share

**2. Behavioral Health Premium Not Recognized**
- 44% of revenue, 56% of EBITDA (higher margin segment)
- Structural tailwinds: mental health crisis, parity laws, aging population
- Pure-play behavioral (Acadia) commands premium, UHS should too

**3. Strong Q3 2025 Performance De-Risks Outlook**
- Revenue beat, guidance raised
- Volume recovery in behavioral (+0.5% admissions)
- Pricing power intact (+8-11% revenue per patient)
- $1.5B buyback signals management confidence

**4. Multiple Paths to Value Realization**
- **Strategic Acquisition**: Most likely, 10-12x EBITDA = $339-$420/share
- **REIT Spin-Off**: Separate PropCo, unlock $20B+ value
- **Continued Buybacks**: $1.5B program at $225 = 7% of shares
- **Multiple Re-Rating**: Market recognizes real estate + behavioral premium

## Recommended Offer Range

**For Strategic Buyer / PE Consortium:**

| Offer Level | Price Range | Premium | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Opening Bid** | **$360-$380** | 60-69% | Below SOTP, establishes floor |
| **Competitive Bid** | **$400-$420** | 78-87% | Near weighted average, fair value |
| **Final Offer** | **$430-$450** | 91-100% | At/above SOTP, pre-emptive |

**Recommended Strategy:**
- Lead with **$375-$400** range (70-78% premium)
- Highlight PropCo/OpCo value creation potential
- Emphasize operational synergies + real estate monetization
- Walk away above $450 unless synergies >$50/share

---

## Next Steps

### For Acquisition Due Diligence:

1. **Validate Real Estate Portfolio**
   - Third-party appraisal of owned facilities
   - Confirm $20-30B range for PropCo value
   - Healthcare REIT interest (Healthpeak, Welltower, Ventas)

2. **Confirm EBITDA Quality**
   - Analyze Q4 2025 results (due Jan 2026)
   - Verify $2.60B+ EBITDA run rate
   - Assess DC Medicaid program sustainability

3. **Engage with Miller Family**
   - 90.5% voting control = MUST negotiate directly
   - Understand liquidity needs / succession planning
   - Valuation expectations (likely >$400/share)

4. **Structure Optimal Deal**
   - Consider PropCo/OpCo split upfront
   - Sale-leaseback with healthcare REIT partner
   - Tax-efficient structure for Miller family
